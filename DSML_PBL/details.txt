Course Recommendation System using Udemy Dataset 


Algorithms 

Cosine Similarity
Linear Similarity

Using "neattext" library which is used in Natural Language processing that helps in removing stop words, special characters, also helps in stemming, lematization, and many nore in NLP.

Workflow: 

1) Importing the dataset.
2) Perfomed Text Processing and EDA and generate insights, then convert text to numeric values.
3) After converting text to numeric values, will calculate the cosine similarity score.
4) Then will sort the values which have similar similarity score and recommend the course.
5) Integrate the Recommendation System with FLASK Framework.
